# MelodicSpark

**MelodicSpark** is a creative Python project that transforms text or numbers into music — blending **literature**, **mathematics**, and **music** into a reverse Big Bang of artistic expression!

This tool reads your input (like a poem, a name, or a sequence of numbers) and generates a unique melody and chord progression, exported as a MIDI file.

## Why MelodicSpark?

This project was created as a way to explore the intersection between structured logic and emotional expression — turning something as abstract as text or numbers into something you can *hear*. It's for anyone fascinated by the strange harmony between words, sound, and code.

---

## Features

- Converts **text or numbers** into a musical piece
- Supports multiple **musical scales** (major, minor, dorian, etc.)
- Exports output as a `.mid` (MIDI) file
- User-friendly CLI: choose your own file path for saving
- Built with [mingus](https://github.com/bspaans/python-mingus)

---

## Who is it for?

This project is designed for:
- Curious coders
- Musicians who love weird ideas
- Artists exploring generative media
- Anyone looking for something strange and beautiful

---

## Installation

You'll need Python 3.8+ and the `mingus` library:

```bash
pip install mingus
```

---

## Usage

Simply run the script:

```bash
python music_generator.py
```

You'll be asked to enter:
- A sentence or a list of numbers (e.g. `Hello world` or `1,2,3`)
- A path to save your MIDI file (e.g. `output.mid`)

The program will analyze the input and create a unique musical composition.

---

## Future Plans

- Graphical interface (GUI)
- Optional export to MP3
- Emotion-based composition using color and sound
- Real-time generative visuals with sound

---

## License

This project is open-source and free to use under the **MIT License**.
